1. Introduction

Diabetes mellitus is a prevalent and impactful chronic metabolic disorder, affecting over 500 million people globally. It ranks as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, bringing about severe complications like cardiovascular diseases, kidney failure, and neuropathy. The existing diagnostic methods, such as fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c tests, are reactive. They often identify diabetes at advanced stages, when irreversible complications have already developed. This not only increases healthcare costs significantly, estimated at billions annually, but also misses the crucial opportunity for early intervention, which is essential for effective disease management and prevention.

Current approaches struggle to integrate various risk factors like genetic, demographic, and lifestyle data for proactive risk stratification, especially in asymptomatic or prediabetic populations. Machine learning (ML) holds great promise in this regard. By analyzing complex, high - dimensional datasets, ML can identify subtle early markers of diabetes. However, existing ML models in healthcare face obstacles in interpretability, scalability, and seamless integration into clinical workflows, which restricts their real - world application.

This project is designed to fill these gaps. We aim to develop an interpretable ML framework that uses easily accessible clinical and demographic data to predict diabetes risk at its earliest stages. Through robust feature selection, model optimization, and user - centric design, we hope to offer healthcare professionals a practical tool for timely and personalized interventions, ultimately reducing the socioeconomic burden of diabetes.

2. Problem Statement
2.1 Problem Description
Diabetes mellitus, a chronic metabolic disorder affecting over 500 million individuals globally, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with severe complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, and neuropathy [1, 2]. Despite its prevalence, conventional diagnostic methods like fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c tests remain reactive, often identifying the disease at advanced stages when irreversible complications have already developed [3]. This delayed detection exacerbates healthcare costs—estimated at billions annually—and limits opportunities for early intervention, which is critical for effective disease management and prevention [4, 5].
Current approaches lack the capability to integrate multifactorial risk factors (e.g., genetic, demographic, and lifestyle data) for proactive risk stratification, particularly in asymptomatic or prediabetic populations. Machine learning (ML) offers a transformative solution by analyzing complex, high-dimensional datasets to identify subtle early markers of diabetes . However, existing ML models in healthcare often face challenges in interpretability, scalability, and seamless integration into clinical workflows, hindering their real-world adoption .
This project addresses these gaps by developing an interpretable ML framework that leverages readily available clinical and demographic data to predict diabetes risk at its earliest stages. By combining robust feature selection, model optimization, and user-centric design, we aim to empower healthcare professionals with a practical tool for timely, personalized interventions, ultimately reducing the socioeconomic burden of diabetes.
3. Data Preprocessing
3.1Data Source and Description
The study utilizes the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, to investigate early-stage diabetes detection. The dataset comprises clinical records of 768 subjects, including eight physiological features and one binary diagnostic outcome:
1. Features: Number of pregnancies (Pregnancies), plasma glucose concentration (Glucose), diastolic blood pressure (BloodPressure), triceps skinfold thickness (SkinThickness), serum insulin level (Insulin), body mass index (BMI), diabetes pedigree function (DiabetesPedigreeFunction), and age (Age).
2. Label: Diabetes diagnosis (Outcome: 0 = negative, 1 = positive).
Although the dataset contains no null or missing values, according to domain knowledge, zero values for certain attributes such as glucose concentration, blood pressure, skin fold thickness, insulin, and BMI are not within the normal range and therefore are inaccurate. To preliminarily identify the pair-wise relationships of the features, one can refer to the scatterplot matrix. If points are scattered randomly, it indicates no obvious relationship; if points roughly align in a straight line, it suggests a linear relationship. By analyzing the scatterplot matrix in Fig. 4, the most closely correlated features include pregnancy and age, skin thickness and BMI, and glucose and insulin because their scatterplots all show a positive correlation. This indicates that there might be a certain linear relationship or proportionality between these features.Initial data inspection revealed. Invalid zero values in key physiological measurements, which are medically implausible for living individuals. For instance:
1. Glucose = 0 mg/dL (impossible in valid blood tests),
2. BloodPressure = 0 mmHg (contradicts clinical standards).
These anomalies affected five critical features, necessitating targeted preprocessing to ensure data integrity
